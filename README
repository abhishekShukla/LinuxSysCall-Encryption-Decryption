DIRECTORY STRUCTURE: /usr/src/hw1-ashuklaravis/hw1/
    
    1. kernel.config
    2. xcipher.c (user space program)
    3. sys_xcrypt.c (Loadable Kernel Module)
    4. Makefile
    5. readme.txt

STEPS TO COMPILE:
    
    1. make (all/xcipher/sys_xcrypt/clean)
    2. insmod sys_xcrypt.ko
    3. To run the user space program
                ./xcipher -h : This will show the options and arguments

       General Scenario:
               ./xcipher -e -p "Password Here" <input_file> <output_file> (For Encryption)
               ./xcipher -d -p "Password Here" <inout_file> <output_file> (For Decryption)

Description:
    
    CHECKING ARGUMENTS: 

        User Space Program:
            
            1. In the user space program, gnuopt(3) has been used as required by the assignment specifications. 
            2. Checks for missing arguments or extra arguments passed. 
            3. Removes the '\n' is used in the password.

        Loadable Kernel Module:
            
            1. Null arguments and pointers to bad addresses are checked (-EINVAL)
            2. If input file and output file cannot be opened or written (implicitly checked by filp_open)
            3. If input file and output file are the same (hard link or soft link) (-EINVAL)
            4. Key length and actual length of the key don't match. (-EINVAL)
            5. While decrypting if the wrong key is given. (-EACCES is returned)

            NOTE: -ENOMEM is returned when kernel cannot allocate memmory. -EFAULT is returned if there is an error during reading or writing.

    ROUTINES USED:
            
            1. vfs_stat : To check for Null arguments and Pointers to bad addresses
            2. kern_path (with LOOKUP_FOLLOW flag) : To check if output file is same as input file
            3. vfs_unlink : To delete the partial output file if encryption or decryption fails

    HASH/ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION Algorithms:
            
            1. MD5 hash:
                    Used in both User Space and Kernel space.

                    To use the MD5 Hash, the following openssl packages were
                    downlaoded in user space.

                     ----------------------------------
                    |NOTE: yum install openssl         |
                    |      yum install openssl-devel   |
                     ----------------------------------
    

                    Goal is to store the double hashed password(from the user space) and store it as preamble in the encrypted file.

            2. ceph_aes_encrypt/ceph_ses_decrypt:

            NOTE: These ciphers automatically add padding data if the data given for encryption is not a multiple of CIPHER_BLOCK_SIZE (16 bytes). 
                  Interesting part is that, when the given data for encryption is a multiple of CIPHER_BLOCK_SIZE, extra 16 bytes of data are padded.
                  This padding data is automatically detected during decryption, thus reducing the effort to store padding information in the preamble. 
                  Hence, the preamble is EQUAL to the size of the MD5 hash function. 
                  Essentially, preamble is double hash (once in user space, once in kernel space) of the password passed to xcipher.c
    
    DESIGN DECISION ON HANDLING OF OUTPUT FILE:

            1. If the output file does not exist, a file is created by the name which is given by the user with the same mode as that of the input file.
            
            2. If the output file already exists: 
                NOTE: If this output file is a hard link or a symbolic link to the inout file, then an error is returned with proper errno set.

                a. If the output file exists and is accessible by the user, then that file is opened and used to the encrypted/decrypted data.
                b. Thus, upon success, the old existing output file is overwritten.
                c. DELETION OF PARTIAL OUTPUT FILE: 
                    
                    If there is failure in the process, the partial output file is deleted. 
                    Disadvantage: If the output file already existed, the user will lose the existing output file. 
                                  This design required the user to be more careful.
